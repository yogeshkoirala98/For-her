    Sristi, being with you just feels right.<b> 
    You make my days better without even trying.<b>
    Every little thing about you 
  .your smile, your laugh, the way you care means so much to me.
   I don’t need fancy words,
    I just want you to know I care about you more than anything.
      You truly mean the world to me and I’m so lucky to have you
